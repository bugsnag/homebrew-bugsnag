# Bugsnag Homebrew Tap

This is a tap for all Bugsnag Homebrew formulae.

## How do I install these formulae?

To install this tap, call

```
brew tap bugsnag/bugsnag
```

To install a specific formula after installing the tap, then call

```
brew install <formula>
```

Or, to do it all in one, install the formula directly. This will also add the Bugsnag Homebrew tap for the future:

```
brew install bugsnag/bugsnag/<formula>
```
